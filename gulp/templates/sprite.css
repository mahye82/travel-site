Do not edit modules/_sprite.css directly. It is auto-generated by the gulp task 'createSprite'. If you want to change
the contents of modules/_sprite.css, then you need to:
1. Edit the template file ./gulp/templates/sprite.css that is used to generate the sprite CSS file
  modules/_sprite.css.
2. Run 'gulp icons' from the command line (inside the root directory of this app).

If you want to add a new icon:
1. Add the icon to ./app/assets/images/icons.
2. Run 'gulp icons' from the command line.

THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS ONLY APPLY TO THE TEMPLATE FILE ./gulp/templates/sprite.css
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

./gulp/templates/sprite.css is a Mustache template file. It is used by the gulp task called createSprite in
./gulp/tasks/sprites/sprites.js. That task makes use of this template file to grab the CSS properties for each icon in
a sprite image that the task also creates, so that we can style our app using the sprite image.

The package gulp-svg-sprite does most of the heavy lifting, aside from the task and this template file.

Everything between the 'shapes' tags below is extracted for each icon (aka 'shape') in the SVG sprite file. Everything
between the 'first' tags is for the first shape in the sprite. Since the background image URL will be the same for all
icons (it's the sprite file, after all), we can put it in its own rule.

So what does the .no-svg .icon mean? .no-svg is a class that will be added to the main <html> element on a page by the
modernizr.js file, if it detects that the browser doesn't support SVG. In that case, we'll want to fallback to using
a PNG sprite image, and so the background-image's url needs to point to the file that ends in '.png'. We do this by
invoking the replaceSvgWithPng with the sprite filename. replaceSvgWithPng originates from the config object in the
createSprite gulp task.

Confused by where the heck all these variables come from? Look at the docs for their meanings:
